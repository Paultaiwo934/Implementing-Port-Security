<h1>Implementing Port Security</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I configured and verified port security on a switch. Port security restricts portâ€™s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>CLI</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>CISCO Packet Tracer</b>

A Rogue laptop was connected to port F0/2, this was flagged as a violation as only PC2 is allowed to connect to F0/2. Therefore, the rogue laptop could not ping PC1:  <br/>
